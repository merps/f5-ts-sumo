This document serves as an admendment to the well documented configuration guides for iApp and 
SumoLogic covering the work conducted with the assistence of Versent and SumoLogic development.

## Security

F5 Telemetry Streaming and the connection to SumoLogic is sent to a preconfigured HTTP Collector, 
as such egress is required for HTTP.


## Background

This work was undertaken to support Telemetry Streaming for Internet accessable BIG-IP's to, initially,
replicate existing Anayltics iApp. As this is merely an admendment, how-to guide, it will only document variations to already well documented procedures for both SumoLogic and F5.

This configuration outline currently only supports the deployment pattern as detailed in the diagram below,

![alt text](https://github.com/thing/here "Reference Deployment")


## Prerequisites

To support this deployment pattern the following components are required:

* F5 BIP-IP (physical or VE)
* SumoLogic configured [HTTP Hosted Collector](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Hosted-Collectors)
* F5 Toolchain Components:
    * [F5 Application Services v3 (AS3)](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/)
    * [F5 Telemetry Streaming (TS)](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
* [SumoLogic](https://service.sumologic.com) Administrator account access.
* [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli-index.html)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) access.
* [AWS Access Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html)


## Installation 

This section will over both the provisioning of the previously mentioned architecture using Terrafrom along
with how-to steps for SumoLogic Hosted Collectors.


### *AWS*

The deployment environment used for development is coovered in detail [F5 AWAF Demo](https://github.com/merps/f5devops/f5-swg-aws),
this is a AWS Deployment example of AutoScaling AWAF. For simplicity, steps replicate this deployment are as follows;

***a)***    First, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/merps/f5devops.git
```

***b)***    Second, create a [tfvars](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) file in the following format to deploy the environment;

#### Inputs
Name | Description | Type | Default | Required
---|---|---|---|---
cidr | CIDR Range for VPC | String | *NA* | **Yes**
region | AWS Deployment Region | String | *NA* | **Yes**
azs | AWS Avaliability Zones | List | *NA* | **Yes** 
secops-profile | SecurityOperations AWS Profile | String | `default` | **Yes**
customer | Customer/Client Short name used for AWS Tag/Naming | String | `customer` | No
environment | Environment Shortname name used for AWS Tag/Naming | String | `demo` | No
project | Project Shortname name used for AWS Tag/Naming | String | `project` | No
ec2_key_name | EC2 KeyPair for Instance Creation | String | *NA* | **Yes**


***c)***    Third, intialise and plan the terraform deployment as follows:
```
cd f5devops/f5-sgw-aws/secure/
terraform init
terraform plan --vars-file ../variables.tfvars
```

this will produce and display the deployment plan using the previously created `varibles.tfvars` file.


***d)***    Then finally to deploy the successfuly plan;
```
terraform apply --vars-file ../variables.tfvars
```

> **_NOTE:_**  This architecture deploys two c4.2xlage PAYG BIG-IP Marketplace instances, it is 
recommended to perform a `terraform destroy` to not incur excessive usage costs outside of free tier.


This deployment also covers the provisioning of the additional F5 prerequeset components so required for 
deployment example covered in the [F5 AWAF Demo](https://github.com/merps/f5devops/f5-swg-aws)


### *SumoLogic*


Provisioning of hosted collectors can be found locate [here](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Hosted-Collectors "Hosted Collectors").  As per archicture deployment, to configure HTTP hosted collector for the consumption of TS:


1. [Login](https://service.sumologic.com) with Adminstrator account access.


2. Select Manage Data -> Collections


<center><img src=images/collection.png width="400"></center>


3. Select *"Add Collector"* - to add new Hosted Collection


<center><img src=images/new.png width="400"></center>


4. Select *"Hosted Collector"* for Collector Type.


<center><img src=images/collector_type.png width="400"></center>


5. Populate *"Add Hosted Collector"* dialog box as per below, then save.


<center><img src=images/collector_config.png width="400"></center>


6. Select **"OK"** to confirm new data source configuration


<center><img src=images/new_source.png width="400"></center>


7. Select *"HTTP Logs & Metrics"*


<center><img src=images/source_type.png width="400"></center>


8. Populate source configuration as per below, then save.


<center><img src=images/source_details.png width="400"></center>



9. Save complete *"Endpoint URL"* as vars and url will be used for the configuration of Telemetry
Streaming configuration.

## Configuration

Similar to the previous section this section will serve only as a quick configuration and amendment
to the existing SumoLogic and F5 Telemetry System Installation Guides.

### SumoLogic

For detailed instructions on how to [Import Content in Library](https://help.sumologic.com/05Search/Library/Export-and-Import-Content-in-the-Library) refer to that link.

For consistency, to import test dashboard for TS, perform the following steps;

1. [Login](https://service.sumologic.com) with Administrator account access.

2. Navigate to *"Personal"* folders, select ***Import*** from the options menu;

<center><img src=images/import.png width="400"></center>

3. Enter **Name** into **Content Import** dialog, this must be unique.

<center><img src=images/import_content.png width="400"></center>

4. Paste contents of [f5-sumo-ts.json](http://github.com/merps/f5devops/f5-sumo-ts/f5-sumo-ts.json) in **JSON** dialog.

5. Click import, this is only available if the json is valid.

### F5 cBIG-IP

As with Sumologic, detailed instructions for the deployment and configuration for TS is located at 
[F5 Telemetry Streaming](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/) with detailed [Sumo Logic](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/setting-up-consumer.html#sumologic-ref) confuguration instructions.

As previously, steps to configure;

1. From the previously created SumoLogic Hosted Collector, extract the follow:

    ***a)*** FQDN = Host

    ***b)*** path = uri

    ***c)*** ciphertext = encrypted token as part of uri

2. Update TS declations with the variables as extracted from ***Endpoint URL*** as per example;
